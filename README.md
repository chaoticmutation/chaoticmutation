- 👋 Hi, I’m @chaoticmutation
- 👀 I’m a student mathematician interested in complex dynamics, higher dimensional spaces, and symmetric groups. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, MatLab, Java, and other coding platforms to assist with research I am working on over the summer. I am working 
- with Julia and Mandelbrot sets for which not a whole lot of packages exist. I am hoping that there are some other people out there who
- share my interests and would like to collaborate. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to work with in creating environments for experiments involving complex systems.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here on github or my email gwmurray@nmu.edu
